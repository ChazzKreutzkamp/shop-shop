# Shop-Shop
## Description

Welcome to Shop-Shop is a marketplace web application, that's more of a proof of concept than an actual shop. This application permits the user to sort shop items by various categories, and even add items to a shopping cart. You can even view your transaction history with an account on the web application. The application also has the api functionality of stripe where you can "purchase" items from the store! (note: that the api is a test api, so no transactions will actually be made by using it, however this is a warning to not use your own personal data while playing with the application).
